# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a Java project focused on subagent context and planning flow ("サブエージェント contextと計画を記録に残すフロー型"). The project appears to be in early development stages with minimal codebase currently present.

## Project Structure
- `docs/` - Contains project documentation
  - `context.md` - Context documentation (currently minimal)
  - `plan.md` - Planning documentation (currently minimal)

## Development Setup
This project is configured as a Java project based on the .gitignore file, but no build system configuration (Maven/Gradle) is currently present. When adding Java source code, you will likely need to:

1. Set up a build system (Maven with pom.xml or Gradle with build.gradle)
2. Create standard Java directory structure (src/main/java, src/test/java)
3. Add necessary dependencies for the subagent functionality

## Documentation
The project maintains documentation in Japanese and appears to focus on subagent context and planning workflows. When contributing, maintain consistency with the existing documentation approach.
